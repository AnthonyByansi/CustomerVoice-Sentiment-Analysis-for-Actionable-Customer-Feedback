## Usage

To use **CustomerVoice** , you will need to collect customer feedback data and `preprocess` it to remove any irrelevant information such as URLs, hashtags, and mentions. You can use the preprocess module to clean and normalize the data.

```python
from customervoice.preprocess import clean_text

# Clean and normalize the text
text = "This product is amazing! I love it so much! #bestproductever"
clean_text(text)
# Output: "product amazing love much"
```

Next, you can use the `sentiment` module to perform sentiment analysis on the customer feedback. CustomerVoice supports both rule-based and machine learning methods for sentiment analysis

```python
from customervoice.sentiment import RuleSentimentAnalyzer

# Initialize the sentiment analyzer
analyzer = RuleSentimentAnalyzer()

# Analyze the sentiment of the text
text = "This product is amazing! I love it so much! #bestproductever"
sentiment = analyzer.analyze(text)
# Output: "positive"
``` 

Finally, you can use the `visualization` module to visualize the results of the sentiment analysis. CustomerVoice supports various visualization techniques such as word clouds, bar charts, and scatter plots.
